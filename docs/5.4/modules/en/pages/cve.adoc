| https://github.com/neuvector/neuvector/security/advisories/GHSA-8pxw-9c75-6w56[CVE-2025-8077]
| For NeuVector deployments on Kubernetes-based environments, the bootstrap password of the default admin user is now generated randomly and stored in a Kubernetes secret. The default admin must retrieve the bootstrap password from the secret and change it after the first successful UI login.

| https://github.com/neuvector/neuvector/security/advisories/GHSA-8ff6-pc43-jwv3[CVE-2025-53884]
| NeuVector now uses a cryptographically secure salt with the PBKDF2 algorithm instead of a simple hash to protect user passwords. During rolling upgrades from earlier versions, NeuVector recalculates and stores the new password hash after each user’s next successful login.

== Sensitive Information Exposure in NeuVector Manager Container Logs

*CVEs:* CVE-2025-46808 +
*CVSS Score:* 6.8 — https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N&version=3.1[CVSS v3.1 Vector] +
*CWE:* https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/532[CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File]

=== Affected Versions

* All versions earlier than `5.0.0`
* Versions `5.0.0` through `5.4.4`

*Fixed version:* `5.4.5`

=== Impact

A vulnerability in NeuVector versions up to and including `5.4.4` could leak sensitive information in the manager container logs. The following fields may appear in logs:

[cols="1,3,2,2,1", options="header"]
|===
| Field | Field Description | Where It Appears | Reproduction | Environment

| `X-R-Sess`
| Rancher session token for single sign-on
| Request header
| Log in via Rancher UI and access NeuVector SSO
| Rancher with NeuVector SSO

| `personal_access_token`
| GitHub or Azure DevOps token
| Request body
| Submit remote repository config under *Configuration > Settings*
| NeuVector

| `token1.token`
| NeuVector user session token
| Response body
| Send GET request through NeuVector API: `https://<neuvector-ui-url>/user?name=<username>`
| NeuVector

| `rekor_public_key`, `root_cert`, `sct_public_key`
| Rekor public key, Root certificate, Signed certificate timestamp (SCT) public key in private root of trust
| Request body
| Create or update private root of trust from Sigstore page
| NeuVector

| `public_key`
| Verifier’s public key
| Request body
| Create or update verifier in Sigstore page
| NeuVector
|===

[NOTE]
====
NeuVector installations with single sign-on integration with Rancher Manager *and* Remote Repository Configuration disabled are not affected.
====

In the patched version, `X-R-Sess` is partially masked. Other sensitive fields (`personal_access_token`, `token`, `rekor_public_key`, `root_cert`, `sct_public_key`, `public_key`) are removed from logs.

[NOTE]
====
* The severity depends on your logging strategy:
** *Local logging (default)* — limits exposure.
** *External logging* — severity increases, depending on security controls on external log collectors.
* The final impact severity depends on permissions of the leaked credentials.
====

For more information, see https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/[Unsecured credentials (MITRE ATT&CK T1552)].

=== Patches

Patched versions include release `5.4.5` and later. Rotate the GitHub token used in Remote Repository Configuration after upgrading.

=== Workarounds

No workarounds are available. Upgrade to a fixed version as soon as possible.
