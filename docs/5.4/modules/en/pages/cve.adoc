== OpenID Connect is vulnerable to MITM

* **CVE ID:** https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H&version=3.1[CVE-2025-66001 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)]
* **CVSS Score:** 8.8

=== Affected Versions

* All versions earlier than `5.3.0`
* Versions `5.3.0` through `5.4.7`

*Fixed version:* `5.4.8`

=== Impact

NeuVector supports authentication using OpenID Connect. TLS verification, which validates the authenticity and integrity of the remote server, is not enforced by default. This can expose the system to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

Beginning with version `5.4.0`, NeuVector supports TLS verification for:

* Registry connections
* Auth server connections (SAML, LDAP, and OIDC)
* Webhook connections

By default, TLS verification remains disabled. The setting is available under *Settings → Configuration* in the NeuVector UI.

In the patched version, new NeuVector deployments enable TLS verification by default. Rolling upgrades do not modify existing configurations to prevent service disruption.

[NOTE]
====
When TLS verification is enabled, it applies to:

* Registry servers  
* Auth servers (SAML, LDAP, and OIDC)  
* Webhook servers  
====

=== Patches

Patched versions include release `v5.4.8` and later.

=== Workarounds

To manually enable TLS verification:

. Open the NeuVector UI.
. Navigate to *Settings → Configuration*.
. In **TLS Self-Signed Certificate Configuration**, select *Enable TLS verification*.
. (Optional) Upload or paste the TLS self-signed certificate.

== Questions and Support

* Contact the SUSE Rancher Security team for security-related inquiries.
* Open an issue in the NeuVector repository.
* Review the support matrix and product support lifecycle.

== NeuVector is shipping cryptographic material into its binary

* **CVE ID:** CVE-2025-54471  
* **CVSS Score:** 6.5 – https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N&version=3.1[AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N]

=== Affected Versions

* All versions earlier than `5.3.0`
* Versions `5.3.0` through `5.4.6`

*Fixed version:* `5.4.7`

=== Impact

NeuVector previously used a hard-coded cryptographic key embedded in the source code. During compilation, this value was replaced with a static secret key used to encrypt sensitive configuration fields.

In the patched release, NeuVector uses the Kubernetes secret `neuvector-store-secret` (in the `neuvector` namespace) to generate secure, dynamic encryption keys. This removes reliance on static keys and improves security by storing keys in Kubernetes-managed secrets.

During rolling upgrades or when restoring from persistent storage, the NeuVector controller checks encrypted configuration fields. If a field is encrypted with the default fixed key, it is decrypted and re-encrypted using the new dynamic key.

If the controller lacks RBAC permissions to access the Kubernetes secret, it logs:

`Required Kubernetes RBAC for secrets are not found`

and exits.

Device encryption keys rotate every 3 months. For more details, see:  
xref:certrotate.adoc#_rotating_sensitive_field_in_configuration[Rotating sensitive field in configuration].

=== Patches

Patched versions include release `v5.4.7` and later.

=== Workarounds

No workarounds are available. Upgrade to a patched version as soon as possible.

== Questions and Support

* Contact the https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/policy[SUSE Rancher Security team].
* Open an issue in the https://github.com/neuvector/neuvector/issues/new/choose[NeuVector GitHub repository].

== Telemetry sender is vulnerable to MITM and DoS

* **CVE ID:** CVE-2025-54470  
* **CVSS Score:** 8.6 – https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H&version=3.1[AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H]

=== Affected Versions

* All versions earlier than `5.3.0`
* Versions `5.3.0` through `5.4.6`

*Fixed versions:* `5.4.7`, `5.3.5`

=== Impact

This vulnerability affects NeuVector deployments only when **Report anonymous cluster data** is enabled. When active, NeuVector sends anonymous telemetry data to:

`https://upgrades.neuvector-upgrade-responder.livestock.rancher.io`

In affected versions, TLS certificate verification is not enforced, making telemetry communication vulnerable to MITM attacks. An attacker could intercept or modify the transmitted data.

NeuVector also loaded the telemetry server response into memory without size limits, exposing the system to Denial-of-Service (DoS) risks.

The patched version includes:

* Verification of the TLS certificate chain and hostname for the telemetry server.
* A response size limit of 256 bytes to mitigate memory exhaustion.

These improvements are enabled by default and require no user action.

=== Patches

Patched versions include release `v5.4.7` and later.

=== Workarounds

If you cannot update, disable **Report anonymous cluster data**:

*Settings → Configuration → Report anonymous cluster data*

Disabling this setting prevents NeuVector from sending telemetry data, reducing exposure to this vulnerability.

*Recommendation:* Upgrade to a patched version as soon as possible.

== Questions and Support

* Contact the https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/policy[SUSE Rancher Security team].
* Open an issue in the https://github.com/neuvector/neuvector/issues/new/choose[NeuVector GitHub repository].

== Sensitive Information Exposure in NeuVector Manager Container Logs

*CVEs:* CVE-2025-46808 +
*CVSS Score:* 6.8 — https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N&version=3.1[CVSS v3.1 Vector] +
*CWE:* https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/532[CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File]

=== Affected Versions

* All versions earlier than `5.0.0`
* Versions `5.0.0` through `5.4.4`

*Fixed version:* `5.4.5`

=== Impact

A vulnerability in NeuVector versions up to and including `5.4.4` could leak sensitive information in the manager container logs. The following fields may appear in logs:

[cols="1,3,2,2,1", options="header"]
|===
| Field | Field Description | Where It Appears | Reproduction | Environment

| `X-R-Sess`
| Rancher session token for single sign-on
| Request header
| Log in via Rancher UI and access NeuVector SSO
| Rancher with NeuVector SSO

| `personal_access_token`
| GitHub or Azure DevOps token
| Request body
| Submit remote repository config under *Configuration > Settings*
| NeuVector

| `token1.token`
| NeuVector user session token
| Response body
| Send GET request through NeuVector API: `https://<neuvector-ui-url>/user?name=<username>`
| NeuVector

| `rekor_public_key`, `root_cert`, `sct_public_key`
| Rekor public key, Root certificate, Signed certificate timestamp (SCT) public key in private root of trust
| Request body
| Create or update private root of trust from Sigstore page
| NeuVector

| `public_key`
| Verifier’s public key
| Request body
| Create or update verifier in Sigstore page
| NeuVector
|===

[NOTE]
====
NeuVector installations with single sign-on integration with Rancher Manager *and* Remote Repository Configuration disabled are not affected.
====

In the patched version, `X-R-Sess` is partially masked. Other sensitive fields (`personal_access_token`, `token`, `rekor_public_key`, `root_cert`, `sct_public_key`, `public_key`) are removed from logs.

[NOTE]
====
* The severity depends on your logging strategy:
** *Local logging (default)* — limits exposure.
** *External logging* — severity increases, depending on security controls on external log collectors.
* The final impact severity depends on permissions of the leaked credentials.
====

For more information, see https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/[Unsecured credentials (MITRE ATT&CK T1552)].

=== Patches

Patched versions include release `5.4.5` and later. Rotate the GitHub token used in Remote Repository Configuration after upgrading.

=== Workarounds

No workarounds are available. Upgrade to a fixed version as soon as possible.
