| ID | Description | Date | Release

| https://github.com/neuvector/neuvector/security/advisories/GHSA-8pxw-9c75-6w56[CVE-2025-8077] 
| For NeuVector deployment on the Kubernetes-based environment, the bootstrap password of the default admin user will be generated randomly and stored in a Kubernetes secret. The default admin will need to get the bootstrap password from the Kubernetes secret first and will be asked to change password after the first UI login is successful.

| https://github.com/neuvector/neuvector/security/advisories/GHSA-8ff6-pc43-jwv3[CVE-2025-53884] 
| NeuVector uses a cryptographically secure salt with the PBKDF2 algorithm instead of a simple hash to protect user passwords.For rolling upgrades from earlier versions, NeuVector recalculates and stores the new password hash only after each user’s next successful login.

| https://github.com/neuvector/neuvector/security/advisories/GHSA-w54x-xfxg-4gxq[CVE-2025-54467] 
| By default, NeuVector redacts process commands that contain the strings password,passwd, pwd, token, or key in security logs, syslog, enforcer debug logs, controller debug logs, webhooks, and support logs. Users can configure a Kubernetes ConfigMap to define custom regex patterns for additional process commands to redact.

== Sensitive Information Exposure in NeuVector Manager Container Logs

*CVE ID:* CVE-2025-46808  
*CVSS Score:* 6.8 — https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N&version=3.1[AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N]  
*CWE:* https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/532[CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File]

=== Affected Versions

* All versions earlier than `5.0.0`
* Versions from `5.0.0` up to and including `5.4.4`

*Fixed version: `5.4.5`*

=== Impact

A vulnerability has been identified in NeuVector versions up to and including `5.4.4`, where sensitive information is leaked into the manager container’s log. The following fields may be exposed:

|NeuVector

|`public_key`
|Verifier’s public key
|Request body
|Create/update verifier in Sigstore page
|NeuVector
|===

[NOTE]
====
NeuVector installations that have single sign-on integration with Rancher Manager and the Remote Repository Configuration disabled are *not affected* by this issue.
====

In the patched version, the `X-R-Sess` value is partially masked for safety. Other fields such as `personal_access_token`, `token`, `rekor_public_key`, `root_cert`, `sct_public_key`, and `public_key` are no longer logged, as request body logging was removed.

[NOTE]
====
* The severity of this vulnerability depends on your logging strategy:
** *Local logging (default):* Limits impact exposure.
** *External logging:* Increases risk, depending on your external log collector's security posture.
* Impact severity may also depend on the permissions of the exposed credentials.

=== Patches

Patched versions include `5.4.5` and above. Users should rotate any GitHub token used in Remote Repository Configuration after upgrading.

=== Workarounds

No workarounds are currently available. Upgrade to the fixed version as soon as possible.
