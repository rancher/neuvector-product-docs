== Deploy and Manage {product-name} through Rancher Extensions or Apps & Marketplace

{product-name} is able to be deployed easily either through Rancher Extensions for Prime customers, or Rancher Apps and Marketplace. The default (Helm-based) {product-name} deployment will deploy {product-name} containers into the cattle-neuvector-system namespace.

[NOTE]
====
Only {product-name} deployments through Rancher Extensions ({product-name}) of Rancher version 2.7.0+, or Apps & Marketplace of Rancher version 2.6.5+ can be managed directly (single sign on to {product-name} console) through Rancher. If adding clusters to Rancher with {product-name} already deployed, or where {product-name} has been deployed directly onto the cluster, these clusters will not be enabled for SSO integration.
====

=== {product-name} UI Extension for Rancher

Rancher Prime customers are able to easily deploy {product-name} and the {product-name} UI Extension for Rancher. This will enable Prime users to monitor and manage certain {product-name} functions and events directly through the Rancher UI. For community users, please see the Deploy {product-name} section below to deploy from Rancher Apps and Marketplace.

. The first step is to enable the Rancher Extensions capability globally if it is not already enabled.

--
image:ui0_extensions.png[extensions]

image:ui1_enable.png[enable]
--
. Install the {product-name}-UI-Ext from the Available list
+
--
image:ui2_installext.png[install]
--
. Reload the extension once installation is completed
+
--
image:ui3reload.png[reload]
--
. On your selected cluster, install the {product-name} application from the {product-name} tab if the {product-name} app is not already installed. This should take you to the App installation steps. For more details on this installation process, see the Deploy {product-name} section below.
+
--
image:ui5installnv.png[install_nv]
--
. The {product-name} dashboard should now be shown from the {product-name} menu for that cluster. From this dashboard, a summary of the security health of the cluster can be monitored. There are interactive elements in the dashboard, such as invoking a wizard to Improve Your (Security Risk) Score, including being able to turn on automated scanning for vulnerabilities if it is not enabled.
+
--
image:ui6dashboard.png[dashboard]

In addition, the links in the upper right of the dashboard provide convenient single sign on (SSO) links to the full {product-name} console for more detailed analysis and configuration.
--
. To uninstall the extension, go back to the Extensions page
+
--
image:ui7uninstall.png[ininstall]

[NOTE]
====
Uninstalling the {product-name} UI extension will NOT uninstall the {product-name} app from each cluster. The {product-name} menu will revert to providing an SSO link into the {product-name} console.
====

=== Deploy {product-name}

First, find the {product-name} chart in Rancher charts, select it and review the instructions and various configuration values. (Optional) Create a project to deploy into if desired, e.g. {product-name}. Note: If you see more than one {product-name} chart, don't select the one that is for upgrading legacy {product-name} 4.x Helm chart deployments.

image:rancher_chart.png[rancher_chart]

Deploy the {product-name} chart, first configuring appropriate values for a Rancher deployment, such as:

* Container run-time, e.g. docker for RKE and containerd for RKE2, or select the K3s value if using K3s.
* Manager service type: change to LoadBalancer if available on public cloud deployments. If access is only desired through Rancher, any allowed value will work here. See the Important note below about changing the default admin password in {product-name}.
* Indicate if this cluster will be either a multi-cluster federated Primary, or remote (or select both if either option is desired).
* Persistent volume for configuration backups

image:rancher_chart_values.png[nv_values]

Click 'Install' after you have reviewed and updated any chart values.

After successful {product-name} deployment, you will see a summary of the deployments, daemon sets, and cron job for {product-name}. You will also be able to see the services deployed in the Services Discovery menu on the left.

image:nv_deployed.png[deployed]

=== Manage {product-name}

You will now see a {product-name} menu item in the left, and selecting that will show a {product-name} tile/button, which when clicked will take you to the {product-name} console, in a new tab.

image:nv_access.png[nv_console]

When this Single Sign On (SSO) access method is used for the first time, a corresponding user in the {product-name} cluster is created for the Rancher user login. The same user name of the Rancher logged in user will be created in {product-name}, with a role of either admin or fedAdmin, and Identity provider as Rancher.

image:nv_admin.png[users]

Note in the above screen shot, two Rancher users admin and gkosaka have been automatically created for SSO. If another user is create manually in {product-name}, the Identity provider would be listed as {product-name}, as shown below. This local user can login directly to the {product-name} console without going through Rancher.

image:local_admin.png[local]

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is recommended to login directly to the {product-name} console as admin/admin to manually change the admin password to a strong password. This will only change the {product-name} identity provider admin user password (you may see another admin user whose identify provider is Rancher). Alternatively, include a xref:configmap.adoc#_protect_sensitive_data_using_a_secret[ConfigMap as a secret] in the initial deployment from Rancher (see chart values for ConfigMap settings) to set the default admin password to a strong password.
====

=== NeuVector/Rancher SSO Permission Resources

The Rancher v2.9.2 UI provides for selecting NeuVector permission resources when creating `Global/Cluster/Project/Namespaces` roles. When a Rancher user is assigned a role with a NeuVector permission resource, the user's NeuVector SSO session is assigned the respective NeuVector permission accordingly. This is to provide SSO users with custom roles other than the reserved `admin/reader/fedAdmin/fedReader` roles.

Below are the mapped permission resources used with applicable `Global/Cluster/Project/Namespaces` roles.

==== Mapped Permission Resources for `Global/Cluster` Role

[NOTE]
====
Users will need to manually add * (Verbs) / services/proxy (Resource) to NeuVector-related `Global/Cluster` Roles.

=== Rancher Legacy Deployments

The sample file will deploy one manager and 3 controllers. It will deploy an enforcer on every node. See the bottom section for specifying dedicated manager or controller nodes using node labels. Note: It is not recommended to deploy (scale) more than one manager behind a load balancer due to potential session state issues.

[NOTE]
====
Deployment on Rancher 2.x/Kubernetes should follow the Kubernetes reference section and/or Helm based deployment.
====

. Deploy the catalog docker-compose-dist.yml, controllers will be deployed on the labelled nodes, enforcers will be deployed on the rest of nodes. (The sample file can be modified so that enforcers are only deployed to the specified nodes.)
. Pick one of controllers for the manager to connect to. Modify the manager's catalog file docker-compose-manager.yml, set CTRL_SERVER_IP to the controller's IP, then deploy the manager catalog.

Here are the sample compose files. If you wish to only deploy one or two of the components just use that section of the file.

Rancher Manager/Controller/Enforcer Compose Sample File:

[,yaml]
----
manager:
   scale: 1
   image: neuvector/manager
   restart: always
   environment:
     - CTRL_SERVER_IP=controller
   ports:
     - 8443:8443
controller:
   scale: 3
   image: neuvector/controller
   restart: always
   privileged: true
   environment:
     - CLUSTER_JOIN_ADDR=controller
   volumes:
     - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
     - /proc:/host/proc:ro
     - /sys/fs/cgroup:/host/cgroup:ro
     - /var/neuvector:/var/neuvector
enforcer:
   image: neuvector/enforcer
   pid: host
   restart: always
   privileged: true
   environment:
     - CLUSTER_JOIN_ADDR=controller
   volumes:
     - /lib/modules:/lib/modules
     - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
     - /proc:/host/proc:ro
     - /sys/fs/cgroup/:/host/cgroup/:ro
   labels:
     io.rancher.scheduler.global: true
----

== Deploy Without Privileged Mode

On some systems, deployment without using privileged mode is supported. These systems must support the ability to add capabilities using the cap_add setting and to set the apparmor profile.

See the sections on deployment with Docker-Compose, Docker UCP/Datacenter for sample compose files.

Here is a sample Rancher compose file for deployment without privileged mode:

[,yaml]
----
manager:
   scale: 1
   image: neuvector/manager
   restart: always
   environment:
     - CTRL_SERVER_IP=controller
   ports:
     - 8443:8443
controller:
   scale: 3
   image: neuvector/controller
   pid: host
   restart: always
   cap_add:
     - SYS_ADMIN
     - NET_ADMIN
     - SYS_PTRACE
   security_opt:
     - apparmor=unconfined
     - seccomp=unconfined
     - label=disable
   environment:
     - CLUSTER_JOIN_ADDR=controller
   volumes:
     - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
     - /proc:/host/proc:ro
     - /sys/fs/cgroup:/host/cgroup:ro
     - /var/neuvector:/var/neuvector
enforcer:
   image: neuvector/enforcer
   pid: host
   restart: always
   cap_add:
     - SYS_ADMIN
     - NET_ADMIN
     - SYS_PTRACE
     - IPC_LOCK
   security_opt:
     - apparmor=unconfined
     - seccomp=unconfined
     - label=disable
   environment:
     - CLUSTER_JOIN_ADDR=controller
   volumes:
     - /lib/modules:/lib/modules
     - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
     - /proc:/host/proc:ro
     - /sys/fs/cgroup/:/host/cgroup/:ro
   labels:
     io.rancher.scheduler.global: true
----

== Using Node Labels for Manager and Controller Nodes

To control which nodes the Manager and Controller are deployed on, label each node. Pick the nodes where the controllers are to be deployed. Label them with "nvcontroller=true". (With the current sample file, no more than one controller can run on the same node.).

For the manager node, label it "`nvmanager=true`".

Add labels in the yaml file. For example for the manager:

[,yaml]
----
   labels:
     io.rancher.scheduler.global: true
     io.rancher.scheduler.affinity:host_label: "nvmanager=true"
----

For the controller:

[,yaml]
----
   labels:
     io.rancher.scheduler.global: true
     io.rancher.scheduler.affinity:host_label: "nvcontroller=true"
----

For the enforcer, to prevent it from running on a controller node (if desired):

[,yaml]
----
  labels:
     io.rancher.scheduler.global: true
     io.rancher.scheduler.affinity:host_label_ne: "nvcontroller=true"
----
