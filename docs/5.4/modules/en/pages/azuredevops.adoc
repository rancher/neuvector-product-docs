== Scan for Vulnerabilities in the Azure DevOps Build Pipeline

The {product-name} scanner can be triggered from the Azure DevOps pipeline by using the {product-name} extension published in the Azure DevOps Marketplace.

The extension supports both remote and local scanning where the {product-name} controller can remotely scan an image in a registry during the build, or dynamically start a local controller to scan the image on the Azure agent vm.

In addition, make sure there is a {product-name} scanner container deployed and configured to connect to the Allinone or Controller. In 4.0 and later, the neuvector/scanner container must be deployed separate from the allinone or controller.

* Scan image with {product-name} task integrates the {product-name} vulnerability scanner into an Azure DevOps Pipeline.
* Perform vulnerability scans of a container image after the image build on an external {product-name} controller instance or on a local {product-name} controller instance which is running in service container inside a pipeline.
* Define thresholds for failing builds based on the number of detected vulnerabilities of different severities.
* Provide a detailed report of an image scan for analysis in the build summary tab.
* External {product-name} controller instances are defined as service endpoints to decouple build pipeline definitions from connection parameters and credentials.
