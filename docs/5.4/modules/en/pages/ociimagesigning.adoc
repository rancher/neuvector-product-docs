== Verify SUSE Rancher Application Collection images with Sigstore

SUSE Rancher Application Collection uses an OCI-based registry where all applications are signed by Sigstore. Users can verify the apps in the Application Collection with Sigstore Verifiers in {product-name}.

You need the cosign public key from SUSE Rancher Application Collection in advance, then the Sigstore Verifiers can be configured in {product-name}.
