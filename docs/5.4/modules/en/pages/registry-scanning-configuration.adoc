= Registry Scanning Configuration
:revdate: 2025-06-25

Registry scanning requires that the {product-name} Allinone or Controller container be deployed on a host/node. Please see the xref:installation.adoc[Installation/Deployment] section for how to deploy the {product-name} containers. Configure registry scanning from the {product-name} console after logging in to the manager.

In addition, make sure there is a {product-name} scanner container deployed and configured to connect to the Allinone or Controller. In 4.0 and later, the neuvector/scanner container must be deployed separate from the allinone or controller.

[NOTE]
====
Registry image scanning is performed by the scanner and the image is pulled and expanded in memory. If expanded image sizes larger than 500MB are expected, consider increasing the scanner memory to 1.5GB or more to provide capacity and headroom for the scanner.
====

To increase registry scanning performance and scalability, multiple scanner pods can be deployed on different nodes to distribute the scanning tasks across multiple scanners. See the section xref:scanners.adoc[Multiple Parallel Scanners] for details.

For multi-cluster (federated) environments, the primary (master) cluster can scan a registry/repo designated as a federated registry. The scan results from these registries will be synchronized to all managed (remote) clusters. This enables display of scan results in the managed cluster console as well as use of the results in admission control rules of the managed cluster. Registries only need to be scanned once instead of by each cluster, reducing CPU/memory and network bandwidth usage. See the xref:multicluster.adoc[multi-cluster] section for more details.

== Configure Registry Scanning

To configure registries and repositories to be scanning, go to the Assets -> Registries menu in the {product-name} console. Add or edit registries to be scanned. Use the Filter to define repositories or subsets of images to be scanned. If your registry requires access through a proxy, this can be configured in Settings -> Configuration.

image:registry-scan.png[Registry]

The registry will be scanned according to a schedule, which is configurable. By default, only new or updated images will be scanned. If you want to re-scan all applicable images whenever the CVE database is updated, select the Rescan After CVE DB Update button when configuring the registry. You can also select Layered Scan to show vulnerabilities by each layer in the image (note: layered scans can take longer and consume more resources to complete).

After the scan is completed you will see the results below it. Click on the repository/tag to see vulnerabilities and click on the vulnerability to see more info. You can also download the report in a CSV file or see the results in the Event logs.

image:image_scan_4.png[Layered]

NeuVector provides a **"View all scanned images"** option. Users don't have to look into a registry to see a specific image. Instead, users can click the last row to list all scanned images.

image:view-all-scanned-images.png[Registry]

Users can also land on the **Registries** page and open specific images from the hyperlink from the **Containers** page. If the image name is not clickable, it means that the image has not been scanned yet.

image:link-to-image-scan-result.png[Container]

The scan results include vulnerabilities by image layer, if this option was selected during registry/repository configuration, as well the compliance checks results. Click the compliance tab when viewing the scan results for the image to see compliance checks.

Scanning will also discover and list all Modules (ie, an inventory) in the image, as shown below. It will also summarize the vulnerability risk by module and list all vulnerabilities for each module.

image:Image_Modules.png[Modules]

Scanning is supported for images on public and private docker registries that are based on Native Docker, Amazon ECR, Redhat/Openshift, jFrog, Microsoft ACR, Sonatype Nexus, Harbor, Google cloud and other registries.  The scan report for the image comprises of the vulnerability status of various packages and binaries in the image. The brief summary of the scan report can be sent via webhook using the Response rule configuration in Policy -> Response Rules, or by Syslog by configuring a syslog server in Settings -> Configuration. Results can also be viewed in the Event logs.

At least one repository filter is required (can't be left blank).

=== Repository filter examples

image:1-filter-examples.png[filters]

[NOTE]
====
. To scan all image tags, add filter as &#42; or &#42;:&#42;. This works on all registry types except the public docker registry.
. Repository should be full name if organization is nil for public docker registry or add library before repository as given above.
. Create a virtual repository and add all local repository to it to scan all tags on a JFrog registry with the subdomain docker access method.
. Regular expressions can be used in a filter. For example alpine:3.[8|9].* will scan all 3.8.x and 3.9.x images and tags on docker hub.
====

=== Registry scan options

* Scan Layers:
** Provides vulnerability scan result for every image layer separately
** Provides information about commands executed, packages added in the layer
** Images size of each layer
* Auto Scan:
** Auto Scan is only supported with OpenShift imagestream integration. Proper role binding should be configured in advance.
** When Auto Scan is enabled, as soon as an image is pushed to the registry, the image scan will be scheduled.
* Periodical Scan:
** Enable periodic scan to scan periodically
** Scan interval can set to be between 5 minutes to every 7 days.
** Because many Admission Control checks rely on image scan result, enabling periodical scan helps make sure Admission Control has the up-to-date information of the images.
** Note that {product-name} will scan images in a regsistry that are new/changed from the previous scan.
* Rescan after CVE DB update
** Enable this option to rescan all images after the vulnerability database is updated.

=== Configuring Proxy server for Registry

Please go to Settings -> Configuration to configure proxy settings for registry scanning.

=== GitHub Container Registry

Available in NeuVector v5.4.3 and later, image scanning is now supported from the https://ghcr.io[GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)], enabling users to include images stored in GitHub in their security and compliance workflows.

==== Add the GitHub Container Registry

To configure the GHCR in NeuVector, go to **Add Registry** and select **GitHub Container Registry** from the registry type dropdown.

|===
| Field | Description

| **Name**
| A name to identify this registry configuration.

| **Registry**
| The GHCR registry URL. Example: `https://ghcr.io/`.

| **User Name**
| Your GitHub username.

| **Token**
| A https://github.com/settings/tokens[GitHub Personal Access Token] with `read:packages` permission (and `repo` if accessing private images).

| **Filter**
| Specify the namespace to scan (e.g., `github_user/hello-world:*` or `repo/package_name:version`).
|===

==== Token Permissions

To access GHCR, you must generate a GitHub token with the following scopes:

* `read:packages` (required)
* `repo` (if accessing private repositories)

You can create a token https://github.com/settings/tokens[here].

==== Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues such as `403 Forbidden` or `invalid credentials`, please ensure:

* Your token has the correct scopes.
* The registry URL is correctly formatted (e.g., `\https://ghcr.io/`).
